# Spoofed Denial of Service (DoS) Attack

## Description
This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a spoofed Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This project is for educational and research purposes only. The goal is to simulate a DoS attack by spoofing IP addresses in order to overwhelm a target server or network with a flood of illegitimate traffic.

**Disclaimer:** 
This project is intended for educational purposes only. Misuse of this code for any malicious activities is strictly prohibited.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/chuckcarne/Spoof_Dos

2. Navigate to the project directory:

  
3. Customize the attack parameters in the `spoofed_dos.py` script according to your target.


5. Run the script:

python spoofed_dos.py


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scapy library

## Configuration
Make sure you configure the following parameters in the `spoofed_dos.py` script:
- **Target IP:** IP address of the target server or network.
- **Spoofed IP Range:** Range of IP addresses to be spoofed.
- **Port:** Target port number.
- **Packet Count:** Number of packets to be sent in each burst.
- **Interval:** Time interval between each burst.
